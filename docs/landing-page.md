# Landing page

_This feature is an experimental feature. Due to this, the setup and configuration of landing page needs to manual work. There's no user interface in Admin panel to configure landing page._

This guide will help you to setup and configure landing page. When the landing page is enabled, it will be served to your users from the root URL of your marketplace. The old root search view will be found from `/s` path.
